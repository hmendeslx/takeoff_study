##### create_takeoff_data.R
- the fields in the input flight data file doesn't match those in the fread(). This produces one warning in computer BLACK and an error in computer WHITE!?? - program does not run on the second computer



##########
- landing gear and flap parameters have to be text to input in takeoff_study.R
- Flight Phase parameter may also be necessary -> possible to copy from one of the original files


#####

* Review tick marks from X and Y axis


final report:
* incluir + graficos numa pagina
* colocar posicao de flaps @ takeoff (resumo de dados)
* vertical line for rotation and liftoff in the graphics



measurements:
* Lift off detection
* Rotation detection
* Max ptcr @ rotation
* T0 = time when SS < -2 ( init of rotation ) - compare this method with the current from the former code
* Rotation time (T0 until Liftoff)
* CAS@T0 = Rotation speed Vr - compare with the speeds calculated by PEP!? 
* CAS@Liftoff - produce distribution
* Mean ptcr during rotation -> produce distributions
* Tailclearence estimation - geometry A340?
* Graphic PTCR (average during rotation?) vs LO distance

Done:

* Create all set of graphics - png files
* Include all the units in the Y column of the graphics
* Covert vector from "character" to "numeric" (eg. LDG_LH, etc...)
	- LDG_LH, LDG_RH, LDG_NOSE
	- FLAPL_0, FLAPL_1, FLAPL_2, FLAPL_3, FLAPL_F
	- CG
* Correct RALT negative values
