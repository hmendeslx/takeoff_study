

* Review tick marks from X and Y axis


final report:
* incluir + graficos numa pagina
* colocar posicao de flaps @ takeoff (resumo de dados)
* vertical line for rotation and liftoff in the graphics



measurements:
* Lift off detection
* Rotation detection
* Max ptcr @ rotation
* T0 = time when SS < -2 ( init of rotation ) - compare this method with the current from the former code
* Rotation time (T0 until Liftoff)
* CAS@T0 = Rotation speed Vr - compare with the speeds calculated by PEP!? 
* CAS@Liftoff - produce distribution
* Mean ptcr during rotation -> produce distributions
* Tailclearence estimation - geometry A340?
* Graphic PTCR (average during rotation?) vs LO distance



Done:

* Create all set of graphics - png files
* Include all the units in the Y column of the graphics
* Covert vector from "character" to "numeric" (eg. LDG_LH, etc...)
	- LDG_LH, LDG_RH, LDG_NOSE
	- FLAPL_0, FLAPL_1, FLAPL_2, FLAPL_3, FLAPL_F
	- CG
* Correct RALT negative values
